Titanic EDA – Data Cleaning & Survival Analysis

This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.
It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights that highlight survival patterns based on age, gender, passenger class, and more.

🚀 Project Objectives

Clean and preprocess the Titanic dataset

Explore missing values and handle them effectively

Perform feature engineering for better insights

Analyze survival patterns using visualizations

Derive key insights from the data

🗂️ Dataset

The dataset used in this project comes from the Kaggle Titanic – Machine Learning from Disaster competition.

Main Features Include:

PassengerId

Survived

Pclass

Name

Sex

Age

SibSp / Parch

Ticket / Fare

Cabin

Embarked

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

✔ Handling missing values (Age, Cabin, Embarked)
✔ Converting categorical variables
✔ Creating new features such as:

FamilySize

Title extraction from Name
✔ Removing duplicates
✔ Treating outliers

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The EDA covers:

📊 Survival Rate by Gender

Females had a significantly higher survival rate.

📊 Survival Rate by Passenger Class

Passengers in 1st class had better survival odds.

📊 Age Distribution

Children had better survival chances compared to adults.

📊 Correlation Heatmap

Identifying key correlations influencing survival.

📊 Fare Analysis

Higher fare passengers survived more frequently.

📈 Visualization Tools Used

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Pandas

NumPy

🧾 Notebook

The analysis is available in this Jupyter Notebook:

🧠 Key Insights

Women and children were prioritized ("Women and Children First").

Upper-class passengers had better access to lifeboats.

Families with moderate size had a higher chance of survival compared to individuals traveling alone.
